## Introduction 

Zerinho6 Bot is a Lite and fast bot that's focused on personal use but available for a public build, I've been working on it for almost 3 years and because of nice people I'm learning how to make a better code and that's also a reason(not the only or main) for Zerinho6 Bot to be open-source.

## Requirements

- I recomment **atleast [node](https://nodejs.org/) 10.x.x, [and here's why](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/issues/1386)**

- [A Discord bot account and the bot Token.](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup

Inside src, create a ``.env`` file **via a IDE because you need it to be without name and windows won't let you do that**...

...It should look like [this](https://github.com/zerinho6bot/Zerinho6-Bot/blob/master/.env.example)

Remember, ``.env`` should not have spaces.

You still need to change the values..

° **TOKEN** being the Discord bot token.

° **PREFIX** being the bot prefix.

° **OWNER** being your Discord user ID.

° **COOLDOWN** being how much the user need to wait to be able to use another command.

° **LANGUAGE** being the bot default language for commands.(Be sure that the language exist on the locales folder or it'll crash)

° **FAST_LOAD** being if you want to load the bot without those detailed things on the console.

° **TERMINAL_RELOAD_INTERVAL** Being how fast the terminal will update if FAST_LOAD is active.

Open the console window on the src folder and type ``npm i``, after that you can do ``node bot.js``. There'll be a message saying when the bot's ready or a lot of things if FAST_LOAD is enabled

Want to know more about the code? There's a whole [Wiki](https://github.com/zerinho6bot/Zerinho6-Bot/wiki) made for for!
## Helping

I'll be very happy with any possible help that you want to give to Zerinho6 Bot, but please, make sure you read the [Wiki](https://github.com/zerinho6bot/Zerinho6-Bot/wiki) and know how the system works, thank you!!!!

## Translating

You wanna translate you bot to your not-yet-translated language? [There's a topic on Wiki saying how you can do that!](https://github.com/zerinho6bot/Zerinho6-Bot/wiki/Translating.)

## Here's a list of really nice people that made this project possible

**Honux(Backend developer of [Teemo.gg](https://teemo.gg/))**: Helped me a lot by giving me instructions for literally 2 years about how to make a good code, what I was doing wrong, what I could do and how I can do.

**Skelun(Frontend developer of [Teemo.gg](https://teemo.gg/))**: Helped me by giving feedback about how a casual user would use Zerinho6 Bot and also helping with the code!

**[Nirewen](https://github.com/nirewen)**: Helped me by saying how x function works or why y thing on Zerinho6 Bot wasn't working.

**[The whole Switchblade Team](https://github.com/orgs/SwitchbladeBot/people)**: A lot of things on Zerinho6 Bot was inspired on [SwitchBlade Bot](https://github.com/SwitchbladeBot/switchblade).

**[Fernando](https://github.com/fernando457829)**: Helped as much as nirewen giving a lot of help with some function not working, what is cool on code and what isn't, it also helped on the last version of Zerinho6 Bot.

**[Acnologia](https://github.com/Acnologla)**: That's being repetitive but thanks is always needed, the same as Nirewen and Fernando, I made Zerinho6 Bot TicTacToe based on a version that he made.

**[Mete](https://github.com/metehus), [Tsugami](https://github.com/Tsugami)**: The same as Nirewen, Fernando, Acnologia and Switchblade Team.

**[Smixqse](https://github.com/smixqse)**: Creator of a old bot called Mixy that doesn't exist anymore, but what started all this Journey.

**[Hellow](https://github.com/HellowDSN)**: Feedback, A LOT of feedback.

**Leticia(Known as topera and my GF)**: For making the bot icon and being such adorable person.
