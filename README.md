## Introduction 

Zerinho6 Bot is a Lite and fast bot that's focused on self-host but available for a public build, I've been working on it since 2016 and because of nice people I'm learning how to make a better code and that's also a reason(not the only or main) for Zerinho6 Bot to be open-source.


## Requirements

- Node.js 12.x.x
- [A Discord bot account and the bot Token.](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup

Inside the app folder, create a ``.env`` file **via a IDE because you need it to be without name and windows won't let you do that**...

Remember, ``.env`` should not have spaces.

You still need to change the values..

° **TOKEN** being the Discord bot token.

° **PREFIX** being the bot prefix.

° **OWNER** being your Discord user ID.

° **COOLDOWN** being how much the user need to wait to be able to use another command.

° **LANGUAGE** being the bot default language for commands.(Be sure that the language exist on the locales folder or it'll crash)

° **FAST_LOAD** being if you want to load the bot without those detailed things on the console.

° **TERMINAL_RELOAD_INTERVAL** Being how fast the terminal will update if FAST_LOAD is active.

° **SET_ACTIVITY** If you want the bot to define it's status.

Open the console window on the app folder and type ``npm i``, after that you can do ``npm start``. There'll be a message saying when the bot's ready or a lot of things if FAST_LOAD is enabled.

## Here's a list of really nice people that made this project possible

**Honux(Backend developer of [Teemo.gg](https://teemo.gg/))**: Helped me a lot by giving me instructions since 2017 about how to make a good code, what I was doing wrong, what I could do and how I can do.

**Skelun(Frontend developer of [Teemo.gg](https://teemo.gg/))**: Helped me by giving feedback about how a casual user would use Zerinho6 Bot and also helping with the code!

**[Nirewen](https://github.com/nirewen)**: Helped me by saying how x function works or why y thing on Zerinho6 Bot wasn't working.

**[The whole Switchblade Team](https://github.com/orgs/SwitchbladeBot/people)**: A lot of things on Zerinho6 Bot was inspired on [SwitchBlade Bot](https://github.com/SwitchbladeBot/switchblade).

**[Fernando](https://github.com/fernando457829)**: Helped as much as nirewen giving a lot of help with some function not working, what is cool on code and what isn't, it also helped on EVERY VERSION of Zerinho6 Bot. 

**[Acnologia](https://github.com/Acnologla)**: I'm being repetitive but thanks is always needed, the same as Nirewen and Fernando, I made Zerinho6 Bot TicTacToe based on a version that he made.

**[Mete](https://github.com/metehus), [Tsugami](https://github.com/Tsugami)**: The same as Nirewen, Fernando, Acnologia and Switchblade Team, but they almost made me like ..forEach, sadly, now he also doesn't like it.

**[Smixqse](https://github.com/smixqse)**: Creator of a old bot called Mixy that doesn't exist anymore, but what started all my Journey.

**[Hellow](https://github.com/HellowDSN)**: Feedback, A LOT of feedback.

**Most of the users from BR PROGRAMMERS**: Without they, Zerinho6 Bot wouldn't exist anymore.

**Leticia(Known as topera)**: For making the bot icon and being such adorable person.
